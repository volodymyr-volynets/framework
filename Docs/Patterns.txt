Database Session State - Keeps the session state on a server in serialized form.

Lazy Load - An object that does not contain all of the data you need but knows
			how to get it.

Mediator - The intent of this pattern is encapsulating the interactions of a set
		   of objects, preventing aggressive coupling from each of them towards
		   the other ones. A Mediator acts as a central point of convergence
		   between the Colleague objects.

Model View Controller - Splits user interface interaction into three distinct
						roles.

Notification - A way to return list of errors instead on throwing exceptions.

Optimistic Offline Lock - Prevents conflicts between concurrent business
						  transactions by detecting a conflict and rolling back
						  the transaction.

Plugin - Links classes during configuration rather than compilation.

Proxy - In the proxy pattern one class stands in for and handles all access to
		another class.

Query Object - An object that represents a database query.

Record Set - An in-memory representation of tabular data.

Registry - A well known object that other ones can use to find related objects 
		   or service.

Table Data Gateway - An object that acts as gateway to a database table. One
					 instance handles all rows in a table.

Table Module - A single instance that handles the business logic for all rows in
			   a database table or view.

Transform View - A view that processes domain data element by element and
				 transforms it into HTML.

Two Step View - Turns domain data into HTML in two steps.

Unit of Work - Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction
			   and coordinates writing out of changes and the resolution of
			   concurrency problems.
